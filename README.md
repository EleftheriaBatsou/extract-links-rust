### Extract external links

Overall, this code demonstrates how to make an asynchronous GET request to a URL, parse the HTML response, and **extract** and print all external links (i.e., links within `<a>` tags with the `href` attribute) from the response using the `select` crate in Rust.

Happy coding!ðŸ¦ž
